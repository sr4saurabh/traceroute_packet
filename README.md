<h1>TraceRoute_Packet v1.1</h1>
<hr>
<h3><spanstyle ="font-style : italic">TraceRoute_Packet is a mini-project fully made by me inspired from the Forouzan's Networking Book.<span></h3>
 <h4> It finds out the route from servers at RAMAIAH INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,BANGALORE to the server you want if their firewall allows passage of ICMP packets. </h4>
 <hr style = "color : black">
<br>
<ul>
<li>It is based on sending the icmp packet to a server and finding the route it goes.</li>
<br>
<li>This Project combines the power of asynchronous JavaScript(Async:Await :) and Child Processes combining it with ICMP to give the path.</li>
<br>
<li> APIs used  -> IpStack.</li>
<ul>
 <p><small> v1.2 coming soon! </small></p>
