TraceRoute_Packet is a mini-project fully made by me inspired from the power that an ICMP packet gives us.
<br>
It is based on sending the icmp packet to a server and finding the route it goes through using the tracroute command.
<br>
Traceroute combines the power of asynchronous JavaScript and Child Processes combining it with ICMP to give the path.
<br>
APIs used is -> IpStack.
