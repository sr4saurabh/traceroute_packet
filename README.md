TraceRoute_Packet is a mini-project fully made by me inspired from the power that an ICMP packet gives us.
It is based on sending the icmp packet to a server and finding the route it goes through using the tracroute command.

Traceroute combines the power of asynchronous JavaScript and Child Processes combining it with ICMP to give the path.
APIs used is -> IpStack.
