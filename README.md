<h3><spanstyle ="font-style : italic">TraceRoute_Packet is a mini-project fully made by me inspired from the Forouzan's Networking Book.<span></h3>
 <h4> It finds out the route from hosting servers to the server[ eg. google.com :) ] you want if their firewall allows passage of ICMP packets. </h4>

<ul>
<li>It is based on sending the icmp packet to a server and finding the route it goes.</li>
<br>
<li>This Project combines the power of asynchronous JavaScript(Async:Await :) and Child Processes combining it with ICMP to give the path.</li>
<br>
<li> APIs used  -> IpStack.</li>
<ul>
